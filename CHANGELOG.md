# Changelog

# Unreleased

New features:

- `--diff` flag to show unified diff of formatting changes without modifying
  files
- `--color` / `--no-color` flags for colored diff output (requires `--diff`)
- `.nph.toml` config file support for project-level configuration
- `--exclude` flag to replace default exclusion patterns
- `--extend-exclude` flag to add patterns to default exclusions
- `--include` flag to customize which files to format
- `--config` flag to specify a custom config file
- Default exclusion patterns for common directories (build, dist, .git,
  nimcache, etc.)
- Files passed explicitly on CLI bypass all exclude filters (matching Black's
  behavior)
- CLI options override config file settings
- pre-commit integration support with `nph` hook
